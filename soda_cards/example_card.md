# Results
Information about study results
- **Presence of gender bias**: yes
- **Overall effect size**: men received around 6% more citations       on average then women (considering year)
- **Effect size after controlling causal factors**: 

papers authored by women receive 10.4 Â± 0.9% fewer citations than would be expected if the papers with the same non-gender-specific properties were written by men
